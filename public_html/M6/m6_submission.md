<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>At the top is a function, getRandomColor(), that creates a color string &quot;#&quot;<br>and it concatenates a random hexadecimal value to it 6 times. Then, that<br>value is returned to the function. setBackgroundColor() sets the color of the page<br>background using the value that will be acquired from getRandomColor(). bounceBall() defines what<br>happens when the ball bounces, and here, we set the colors of each<br>element to change. They each call the getRandomColor() function.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I learned that modifying a game can be a lot of fun and<br>easy once the foundation has been laid! This assignment reminds me of IT<br>201 where I had to create my own application from the ground up<br>(one that I also linked on the .html page). This has also revealed<br>to me how a lot of HTML5 games are functional and possible now<br>that Adobe Flash has shut down. JavaScript opens up a lot of doors<br>of possibilities for web game developers. Getting a peek into what web game<br>developers tinker with on a daily basis has been intriguing.</div><div><br></div><div>As for specific details<br>I've learned, I learned that the Canvas dimensions go from 0,0 to inf,inf.<br>As a result, -x and +x are left and right specifically, but -y<br>and y+ are up and down (opposite of what we'd think a mathematical<br>xy-graph would look like). My confusion over this portion was explained away by<br>this information. Additionally, whatever is drawn first is the background and whatever is<br>drawn last is the foreground.</div><div><br></div><div>Additionally, I learned how to decrease the ball's acceleration<br>in the code so there's not only 3 or 4 collisions that take<br>place before the ball hits Mach 3. I also made the starting instructions<br>clearer for Player 2 so it's clear that they need to use the<br>Up and Down arrow keys in order to play.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
